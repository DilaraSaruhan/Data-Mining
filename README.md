Problem:

In a health application, a decision tree model has been created to determine the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of a patient. 
The model classifies patients into "High Risk" and "Low Risk" based on a set of health criteria and age information.

Using KNN,
NAIVE BAYES, 
and C4.5 DECISION TREE, 
we will answer the following question with the model you create:
For a 45-year-old patient with normal blood pressure, low cholesterol levels, non-smoker, and regular exercise, what is the cardiovascular disease risk for this patient?
